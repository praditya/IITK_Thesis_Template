\section{Forward Dynamics}

The forward dynamics of the quadruped can be derived using Lagrangian or Newton-Euler method \cite{greenwood1997classical}. 

\subsection{Equation of Motion}\label{EoMderive}
The equation of motion for a rigid multi-body system is usually written in a canonical form \cite{featherstone2014rigid}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EoM}
M(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{\dot{u}} + {C}(\mathbf{q,u}) =  \boldsymbol{\tau},
\end{equation}

Refer to Eq. \ref{eq:EoM}
